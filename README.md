## 🎯 Principles I ship by

- **User value first**: features should move metrics, not just backlog tickets.
- **Architecture with intent**: keep it scalable, observable, and maintainable.
- **Developer experience matters**: better tooling = faster, safer delivery.
- **Teach while building**: mentorship is part of engineering output.
